## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Engineer with experience building **production-grade web applications** using modern JavaScript frameworks and **serverless cloud infrastructure**.  
My work focuses on designing scalable systems, clean APIs, and maintainable architectures that can move from concept to production efficiently.

I enjoy working across the stack — from UI and animation to backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling.
